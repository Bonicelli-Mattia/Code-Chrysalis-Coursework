# Code-Chrysalis-Coursework
Because the Code Chrysalis "liberation" process was never fixed.

Stripped of the readmes because they contain information I can't share, probably.

Each folder represents a branch for a project, the master branch was the branch given at the beginning of the assignment, most projects were conducted in groups of 2 or 3 people.
When there are multiple branches the project was first started in a group and then finished as an individual.
